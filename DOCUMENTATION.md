# FilterTube Documentation

## Overview

FilterTube is a browser extension designed to filter YouTube content based on user-defined keywords and channels. The extension uses a CSS-based filtering approach combined with JavaScript DOM manipulation to hide unwanted content while preserving optimal performance.

## Technical Architecture

### Manifest Version

FilterTube uses Manifest V3, the current browser extension platform standard. This ensures compatibility with modern browsers and follows security best practices.

```json
"manifest_version": 3,
"version": "1.1.0"
```

### Components

The extension is built with the following key components:

1. **Background Script** (`js/background.js`)
   - Handles browser icon clicks
   - Manages extension installation/updates
   - Responds to messages from content scripts

2. **Content Script** (`js/content.js`)
   - Injects into YouTube pages
   - Reads filter settings from storage
   - Identifies and filters video elements
   - Uses MutationObserver to handle dynamic content
   - Applies CSS classes for visibility control

3. **Popup Interface** (`html/popup.html` and `js/popup.js`)
   - Provides user interface for configuring filters
   - Saves settings to browser storage
   - Offers comment filtering options

4. **Stylesheet** (`css/content.css`)
   - Defines visibility rules for filtered content
   - Uses inverted logic (hide by default, reveal wanted content)
   - Contains layout fixes for various YouTube page types

### Filter Implementation

The filtering system uses an inverted approach for better performance:

1. Hide all potential video elements with CSS initially
2. Add a `.filter-tube-visible` class to elements that should be shown
3. This approach prevents "flickering" as content loads and gets filtered

### Key JavaScript Functions

- `loadSettings()`: Loads filter preferences from storage
- `hideSuggestionsByPreferences()`: Main filtering coordinator
- `hideVideos()`, `hidePlaylistsAndShelves()`, etc.: Target specific content types
- `shouldFilterChannel()`: Determines if a channel should be filtered
- `extractChannelInfo()`: Extracts channel names and handles from elements
- `fixSearchResultsLayout()`: Fixes layout issues after filtering
- `forceChannelGridLayout()`: Aggressively fixes channel page layouts

## Version History

2. Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create a zip file containing all necessary extension files
4. Test the packaged extension thoroughly before distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Videos not being filtered**
   - Check that valid keywords or channels are entered
   - Ensure the extension has access to YouTube.com
   - Try refreshing the page after saving new filters

2. **Layout problems after filtering**
   - YouTube regularly updates its DOM structure
   - Report specific layout issues with screenshots
   - Check browser console for any error messages

3. **Performance concerns**
   - Filter lists with many entries might impact performance
   - Consider using more specific filters for better results
