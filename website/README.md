# FilterTube Landing Page

This directory contains the files for the FilterTube browser extension's promotional landing page.

## Structure

*   `index.html`: The main single-page HTML file.
*   `style.css`: Contains all CSS rules for styling, layout, and responsiveness.
*   `script.js`: Includes JavaScript for interactivity (mobile navigation, scroll animations).
*   `privacy.html`: The dedicated privacy policy page.
*   `DESIGN_PLAN.md`: The Markdown document outlining the design and structure decisions.

## Development

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page locally.

## Deployment (e.g., Hostinger)

1.  Upload the contents of this `website` directory (excluding `DESIGN_PLAN.md` if desired) to the root directory (e.g., `public_html`) of your Hostinger web hosting account.
2.  Ensure the server correctly serves `index.html` as the default page.

## Placeholders

Remember to replace the placeholder links (e.g., `#chrome-store`, `#firefox-store`, `#github-repo`, `#github-license`, `#notify-mobile`) in `index.html` with the actual URLs once they are available.

Update the content in `privacy.html` with your final privacy policy details.
