            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### **NEW v3.2.1: Topic Channel Support**

| Topic Channel Tooltip | No @handle/customUrl | ✅ **NEW** | Shows explanatory tooltip in UI |

**Topic Channel Logic:**
```javascript
function isTopicChannel(channel) {
    const name = channel?.name || '';
    const hasTopicSuffix = /\s-\sTopic$/i.test(name);
    const hasNoHandle = !channel.handle && !channel.customUrl;
    const hasUcId = channel.id?.startsWith('UC');
    return hasTopicSuffix && hasNoHandle && hasUcId;
}
```

### **NEW v3.2.1: Post-Block Enrichment System**

| Feature | Purpose | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### New DOM elements from sample
| DOM tag / component | Associated data | Coverage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-rich-item-renderer>` | Hosts rich grid cards | ✅ Data surfaces through `richItemRenderer` which we filter pre-DOM |
| `<yt-lockup-view-model>` & child `<yt-lockup-metadata-view-model>` | Carries title, byline, metadata | ✅ JSON consumed via `lockupViewModel` paths @js/filter_logic.js#150-154 |
| `<yt-collection-thumbnail-view-model>` / `<yt-collections-stack>` | Visual mix thumbnail stack | ℹ️ Visual only; no keyword-bearing text | No filtering required unless we hide thumbnails later |
| `<yt-thumbnail-view-model>` | Thumbnail container | ℹ️ Covered indirectly when we hide filtered cards |
| `<yt-thumbnail-overlay-badge-view-model>` (Mix badge) | Badge text like “Mix” | ⚠️ Not parsed; consider adding to keyword scan if badges become relevant |
| `yt-chip-cloud-chip-renderer` (filter chips) | DOM-only | ✅ Mixes chip hidden when `hideMixPlaylists` is enabled |

### Home shelf: “Latest YouTube posts” (2025-11-18 sample, NEW)
| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-rich-section-renderer>` | `richSectionRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** – layout | Container around shelf; ensure recursion reaches embedded shelf contents |
| `<ytd-rich-shelf-renderer is-post>` | `richShelfRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** – layout | Hosts post cards; relies on nested `richItemRenderer` data already intercepted |
| `<ytd-post-renderer>` | `backstagePostRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Home community posts now properly extracted for menu blocking; channel info extracted from author links |
| `<ytd-expander id="expander">` | `backstagePostRenderer.content` | ⚠️ **NEW** – partial | Expanded post text lives here when collapsed; confirm JSON contains same text or add DOM fallback |
| `<yt-formatted-string id="home-content-text">` | DOM-only | ℹ️ **NEW** | Displays post body when expander hidden; monitor as potential fallback source |
| `<ytd-backstage-image-renderer>` | `backstageImageRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** | Image attachment metadata minimal; rely on parent post text for filtering |
| `<ytd-backstage-poll-renderer>` | `backstagePollRenderer` | ❌ **NEW** – missing | Poll prompt/options show here; extend renderer rules when filtering polls |
| `<ytd-comment-action-buttons-renderer>` | DOM-only | ℹ️ **NEW** | Toolbar (like/share/comment); no keyword-bearing strings |
| `<ytd-menu-renderer>` | `menuRenderer` | ⚠️ **NEW** – verify | Overflow menu labels (e.g., “Not interested”) may need coverage if we target UI text |
| `<ytd-toggle-button-renderer>` | `toggleButtonRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** | Like/dislike toggles for posts; currently UI only |

### Subscriptions feed (2025-11-18 sample, NEW)
| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-rich-grid-renderer page-subtype="subscriptions">` | `richGridRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** – layout | Same grid container as home; confirm recursion so subscription cards filter pre-DOM |
| `<yt-thumbnail-badge-view-model>` (LIVE / duration) | `thumbnailBadgeViewModel` | ⚠️ **NEW** – not parsed | “LIVE” and runtime badges exposed here; evaluate if we need keyword rules to treat live streams differently |
| `<yt-content-metadata-view-model>` | `contentMetadataViewModel` | ⚠️ **NEW** – partial | Shows “2 watching”, “1 hour ago”; ensure renderer extraction captures live viewer counts in addition to view tallies |
| `<button-view-model>` | `buttonViewModel` | ℹ️ **NEW** | Drives overflow menus per card; UI text only today |
| `<ytd-subscription-notification-toggle-button-renderer-next>` | `subscriptionNotificationToggleButtonRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** | Notification bell states; strings limited to UI ("Subscribed"); track in case filters target notification text |
| `<ytd-badge-supported-renderer>` (verified badge) | `metadataBadgeRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** | Badge exposes "Official Artist Channel"; low priority unless badges become filter inputs |

### Collaboration Videos + Watch Page (2025-12-21 snapshot, NEW)

YouTube collaboration videos can feature up to **5 collaborating channels + 1 uploader** (6 total). This requires special handling in both data extraction and UI.

#### Data Sources

| Source | Location | Data Available | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ytInitialData (Primary)** | `videoRenderer.longBylineText.runs[].navigationEndpoint.showDialogCommand.panelLoadingStrategy.inlineContent.dialogViewModel.customContent.listViewModel.listItems[]` | Full channel info for ALL collaborators | ✅ Covered |
| **DOM Fallback** | `#attributed-channel-name > yt-text-view-model` | Channel names, partial handles (first channel only has direct link) | ✅ Covered |

#### ytInitialData Structure for Collaborators

Each collaborator in `listItems[].listItemViewModel`:
| Field Path | Data | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title.content` | Channel name | `"fern"` |
| `subtitle.content` | Handle + subscriber count (Unicode wrapped) | `"‎⁨@fern-tv⁩ • ⁨42.7 lakh subscribers⁩"` |
| `rendererContext.commandContext.onTap.innertubeCommand.browseEndpoint.browseId` | UC ID | `"UCODHrzPMGbNv67e84WDZhQQ"` |

**Note:** `canonicalBaseUrl` is NOT present inside `showDialogCommand` - the `@handle` must be extracted from `subtitle.content` using regex.

#### DOM Elements

| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<div id="attributed-channel-name">` | `attributedChannelName` in `lockupViewModel.byline` | ✅ Covered | Detects collaboration videos; triggers special handling |
| `<yt-text-view-model>` with attributed string | DOM-only collaboration display | ✅ Covered | Parses "Channel A ✓ and Channel B ✓" format |
| `<yt-core-attributed-string>` | Contains channel spans | ✅ Covered | Each span has channel name |
| `<yt-avatar-stack-view-model>` | DOM-only (avatar stack) | ✅ Covered | Used to seed collaborator lists and detect collaboration dialog triggers when present |
| `<a href="/@handle">` | Direct channel link | ⚠️ Partial | Only FIRST channel has direct link in DOM; others require ytInitialData lookup |
| `badge-shape[title*="•"]` | DOM-only badges | ✅ Covered | Regex `@([A-Za-z0-9._-]+)` extracts handles even when encoded as `@foo.bar` |

#### 3-Dot Menu UI for Collaborations

| Menu Option | When Shown | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Block [Channel N] | 2+ collaborators | Blocks individual channel, stores `collaborationWith` metadata |
| Block All Collaborators | 2+ collaborators | Blocks ALL channels independently with shared `collaborationGroupId` |
| Done • Block X Selected | 3-6 collaborators | Appears after selecting rows in multi-step mode; persists only selections |

#### Watch page notes (v3.2.1)

- **Main video + right rail:** Watch-page dropdowns consume the same collaborator cache as Home/Search, so per-channel menu rows (and “Block All”) appear with names/handles even when the DOM only exposed “Channel A and 3 more”.
- **Embedded Shorts:** Shorts surfaced inside the watch column mark `fetchStrategy: 'shorts'`; we prefetch `/shorts/<videoId>` before falling back to `/watch?v=` so collaborator menus and UC IDs hydrate reliably.
- **Single-channel rows:** Still display “Block Channel” in some cases when the DOM scrape does not include the channel name.
- **Watch playlist panel:** Playlist panel rows now hide deterministically for blocked channels (prefetch enriches `videoChannelMap` for playlist items), and Next/Prev navigation skips blocked items without visible playback flash.
- **Watch playlist autoplay:** Autoplay uses an `ended`-event safety net to trigger a Next-click only when the immediate next playlist row is blocked, preventing blocked items from briefly playing.
- **Playlist reprocessing robustness:** Previously hidden playlist rows are kept hidden during identity gaps (sticky-hide) to prevent restored blocked items from becoming playable during async enrichment.
- **Dropdown close behavior:** The 3-dot dropdown close logic avoids closing `ytd-miniplayer` when a miniplayer is visible.
- **ENHANCED v3.2.1:** Avatar stack collaboration detection now works on Mix cards and surfaces where `avatarStackViewModel` is used instead of `showDialogCommand`.
- **ENHANCED v3.2.1:** Collaboration detection now properly excludes Mix cards (collection stacks) from being treated as collaborations.

**Multi-select note (3+ collaborators):**
When there are 3–6 collaborators, individual rows act as “select” toggles first. The bottom row becomes:
`Done • Block X Selected` and will persist only those selected collaborators.

#### Storage Schema for Collaboration Entries

```javascript
{
  id: "UCxxxxxx",           // UC ID
  handle: "@channelname",   // @handle
  customUrl: "c/LegacyName", // legacy channel URL (optional)
  name: "Channel Name",     // Display name
  filterAll: true/false,    // Filter All toggle state
  collaborationWith: ["@other1", "@other2"],  // Other collaborators (for UI display)
  collaborationGroupId: "uuid-xxx"            // Links related entries (for group operations)
}
```

#### Collaboration DOM + Cache Attributes (important)

FilterTube stamps/caches collaborator rosters on cards so collaboration menus can render immediately even before Main World enrichment finishes.

| Attribute | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-filtertube-video-id` | card + wrapper | Stable video ID used for cache validation and Main World lookups |
| `data-filtertube-collaborators` | card | JSON string of `{name, handle, id, customUrl}` for collaborators |
| `data-filtertube-collaborators-source` | card | Source tag: e.g. `lockup`, `dialog`, `mainworld` |
| `data-filtertube-collaborators-ts` | card | Timestamp for stale-cache detection |
| `data-filtertube-expected-collaborators` | card | Expected collaborator count (supports “+ N more”) |
| `data-filtertube-channel-custom` | card | Legacy channel identifier (`c/<slug>` or `user/<slug>`) |

#### Collaboration Menu Item Attributes

| Attribute | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-collab-key` | menu row | Key for the collaborator row (derived from `id` or `@handle` or `customUrl`) |
| `data-collaboration-with` | menu row | JSON of “other collaborators” for UI grouping |
| `data-collaboration-group-id` | menu row | Group ID used to connect related collaboration entries |
| `data-is-block-all="true"` | menu row | Marks the “All collaborators / Done” row |
| `data-multi-step="true"` | menu row | Enables multi-select behavior for 3+ collaborators |

#### Cross-World Communication

Since content_bridge.js runs in **Isolated World** (no `ytInitialData` access), collaboration data requires message-based lookup:
1. DOM extraction detects collaboration video
2. If collaborator data incomplete → request from Main World via `FilterTube_RequestCollaboratorInfo`
3. injector.js (Main World) searches `ytInitialData` and responds with `FilterTube_CollaboratorInfoResponse`
4. content_bridge.js enriches collaborator data and injects menu options
5. background.js persists `collaborationGroupId`, `collaborationWith`, `allCollaborators`; UI renders dashed/yellow rails via `render_engine.js`

#### Renderer/UI Mapping
| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `filter_logic.js` | Extracts collaborator listItems, normalizes handles (lowercase, dots/underscores allowed) |
| `content_bridge.js` | Generates group IDs, injects block-all menu entries, and hides DOM nodes immediately |
| `render_engine.js` | Computes `presentCount/totalCount`, adds 🤝 badge + tooltip text |

### Shorts Collaborations & Canonical IDs (2025-12 sample)

| Source | Path / Selector | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DOM | `ytd-shorts-lockup-view-model`, `.reel-item` | Shorts cards often omit UC IDs; only handle is available |
| Fetch | `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/<id>` | Used to extract uploader handle when missing from DOM |
| Fetch | `https://www.youtube.com/@handle/about` | Resolves canonical `UC...` ID via regex `channel/(UC[\w-]{22})` |

**Flow Recap:** detect Short → hide container → resolve handle → resolve UC ID → persist → broadcast so interceptors catch future cards.

### Podcasts shelf (Podcasts tab, 2025-11-18 sample)
| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-rich-shelf-renderer layout="podcasts">` | `richShelfRenderer` | ℹ️ Layout | Container for podcasts shelf; traversal reaches nested `podcastRenderer` entries |
| `<ytd-rich-item-renderer is-shelf-item>` | `podcastRenderer` payload | ✅ Covered | Podcast title/description + publisher captured, including metadata rows |
| `<yt-collection-thumbnail-view-model>` | `lockupViewModel.collectionThumbnailViewModel` | ℹ️ | Stack thumbnail + square art; no additional text beyond badges (playlist lockups hidden when `hidePlaylistCards` is on, but Mix/Radio lockups are excluded via `start_radio=1`) |
| `<yt-thumbnail-overlay-badge-view-model>` | `thumbnailBadgeViewModel` | ⚠️ Partial | Badge text like “1 episode”; evaluate keyword needs later |
| `<yt-content-metadata-view-model>` | `contentMetadataViewModel` | ✅ Covered | Metadata rows now parsed via helper fallback |

## Search Results & Generic Lists

### Existing coverage
| JSON renderer key | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `videoRenderer` / `compactVideoRenderer` | Main search results & sidebar items | ✅ Covered @js/filter_logic.js#129-131 |
| `playlistVideoRenderer` / `compactRadioRenderer` | Playlist search hits | ✅ Covered @js/filter_logic.js#132-215 |
| `secondarySearchContainerRenderer` | Container around secondary results | ✅ Covered @js/filter_logic.js#232-235 |

### DOM elements from 2025-11-17 sample (NEW)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Search page `ytd-video-renderer` structure differs from home page `yt-lockup-view-model`**

On **home page** (`yt-lockup-view-model`):
- `data-filtertube-channel-handle` is on the channel link inside `.yt-lockup-metadata-view-model__metadata`
- Channel name text is in the same element

On **search page** (`ytd-video-renderer`):
- `data-filtertube-channel-handle` is on the **thumbnail link** (`#thumbnail a`)
- Thumbnail link contains **overlay text** (duration like "25:31", "Now playing")
- Channel name is in a **separate location**: `#channel-info > ytd-channel-name > a`

**Solution**: When extracting channel name with data attributes present, ALWAYS query `#channel-info ytd-channel-name a` first, never rely on the data-attribute element's textContent.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<yt-related-chip-cloud-renderer>` | `relatedChipCloudRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Container metadata now parsed for chip subtitles; keyword filtering can suppress chip groups |
| `<yt-chip-cloud-renderer>` | `chipCloudRenderer` | ℹ️ Layout | Hosts chip list; parser now recurses into child chips |
| `<yt-chip-cloud-chip-renderer>` | `chipCloudChipRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Chip labels & navigation endpoints feed into keyword + channel handle filtering |
| `<chip-shape>` button label | DOM-only | ⚠️ Fallback | Still monitor if chips ship DOM-only text without JSON |

### New DOM notes
- Provided HTML did not include right-rail markup; request additional samples (expect `<ytd-compact-video-renderer>` with `compactAutoplayRenderer`).
- Description snippet now wrapped in `ytd-text-inline-expander`; confirm `videoDetails.shortDescription`/`descriptionSnippet` fields remain populated for filtering.

## Channel Page

| `<ytd-section-list-renderer>` / `<ytd-item-section-renderer>` | `twoColumnBrowseResultsRenderer.tabs[].sectionListRenderer` | ℹ️ **NEW** – layout | Structural containers; no filtering today |
| `<ytd-grid-video-renderer>` | `gridVideoRenderer` | ✅ Covered — **NEW** | Same renderer rules as home/search; confirm supports joint-channel bylines |

### Playlists tab controls (2025-11-18 sample, NEW)
| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-channel-sub-menu-renderer>` | `channelSubMenuRenderer` | ⚠️ **NEW** – not parsed | Hosts Playlists tab dropdown (“Created playlists”); add renderer rules if menu text needs keyword filtering |
| `<yt-sort-filter-sub-menu-renderer>` | `sortFilterSubMenuRenderer` | ⚠️ **NEW** – missing | Provides “Sort by” options; confirm JSON paths before scanning sort labels |
| `<yt-dropdown-menu>` / `<tp-yt-paper-menu-button>` / `<tp-yt-paper-listbox>` | DOM-only | ℹ️ **NEW** | UI shell around submenu; relies on parent renderer for strings |
| `<ytd-grid-renderer>` (Playlists tab) | `gridRenderer` containing `items[].lockupViewModel` | ℹ️ **NEW** | Structural grid; ensure recursion reaches playlist lockups |
| `<yt-content-metadata-view-model>` | `contentMetadataViewModel` | ⚠️ **NEW** – partial | Surfaces playlist metadata rows (counts, “Updated” dates); consider parsing if keywords must match |

### Posts tab / Community feed (2025-11-18 sample)
| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-backstage-items>` | `sectionListRenderer.contents[].backstageItems` | ℹ️ **NEW** – layout | Container for community threads; ensure recursion reaches `backstagePostThreadRenderer` entries |
| `<ytd-comments-header-renderer is-backstage>` | `commentsHeaderRenderer` (backstage) | ⚠️ Partial | Header text still unchecked; evaluate after main post coverage |
| `<ytd-backstage-post-thread-renderer>` | `backstagePostThreadRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Thread wrappers parsed; ensures nested posts obey keyword/channel filters |
| `<ytd-backstage-post-renderer>` | `backstagePostRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Post body, attachments, author channel IDs/handles extracted |
| `<ytd-backstage-image-renderer>` | `backstageImageRenderer` | ℹ️ | Image attachment metadata minimal; rely on parent post text for now |
| `<ytd-backstage-poll-renderer>` | `backstagePollRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Poll prompts/options now included in keyword scanning |
| `<ytd-backstage-quiz-renderer>` | `backstageQuizRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Quiz question/choices exposed for filters |

### Gaps to monitor
- Confirm whether `channelFeaturedContentRenderer` or `channelAboutMetadataRenderer` appear in JSON; add entries if descriptions or featured playlists bypass existing rules.
- Validate continuation tokens for channel shelves so hidden videos are not re-fetched.
- Add renderer coverage for `channelSubMenuRenderer` / `sortFilterSubMenuRenderer` if playlist menu text needs filtering.
- Decide if `contentMetadataViewModel` metadata rows require keyword scanning (e.g., updated timestamps, video counts).
- Evaluate backstage header/menus once there is a requirement to filter them.

## Shorts

### Existing coverage
| JSON renderer key | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reelItemRenderer`, `shortsLockupViewModel`, `shortsLockupViewModelV2` | Shorts feeds | ✅ Covered @js/filter_logic.js#179-193 |

### Observed gaps
- No new Shorts DOM included. Continue validating for `yt-reel-player-overlay` variants.

## Watch Playlist Panel

### Existing coverage
| JSON renderer key | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `playlistPanelRenderer` | Watch-page mini playlist (Up Next queue) | ⚠️ Partial @js/filter_logic.js#206-215 |
| `playlistPanelVideoRenderer` | Individual playlist items within panel | ✅ Covered @js/filter_logic.js#129-133 |

### Lockup / Shelf Playlists (Related section)
| JSON renderer key | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lockupViewModel` (playlist variant) | Horizontal playlist promos | ✅ Covered @js/filter_logic.js#149-154 |

| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<yt-lockup-view-model>` (playlist) | `lockupViewModel` | ✅ Covered — **NEW** | Existing lockup rules pick up title/channel; badge text (video counts) still DOM-only |
| `<yt-collection-thumbnail-view-model>` / `<yt-collections-stack>` | Collection thumbnail stack | ℹ️ **NEW** | Visual only; continue to ignore unless we filter by thumbnail badges |

### Follow-ups
- Verify we recurse into `playlistPanelRenderer.contents` to filter continuation responses when playlists auto-advance.
- Decide if playlist badges (`yt-thumbnail-overlay-badge-view-model`) need keyword filtering when they include captions like “AI Summary”.
- Capture playlist publisher names in renderer rules if keyword filtering should cover collaborators (e.g., “Playlist” taxonomy strings).
- Evaluate playlist overlays (`thumbnailOverlayPlaybackStatusRenderer`, resume progress, “Now playing”) in case watched-state strings become filter signals.

| `<yt-chip-cloud-chip-renderer>` | Individual chips ("Music", "Mixes") | ❌ Not targeted |
| `<chip-shape>` button text | Visible string we might want to filter | ⚠️ Consider parsing if chips drive exposure to undesired topics |

These chips originate from the YouTube UI rather than API payloads we currently filter; we may need DOM-level observers if we want to auto-select or hide them.

## Notifications (Bell / Inbox)

| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-notification-renderer>` | `notificationRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Headline, long message, and channel IDs/handles now parsed |

## Action Items
1. Add renderer support for `compactAutoplayRenderer`, `watchCardHeroVideoRenderer`, and `watchCardSectionSequenceRenderer`.
2. Confirm extraction of search snippet text (`metadata-snippet-text`, AI summaries) and extend keyword scanning if JSON does not carry full descriptions.
3. Decide whether badge text (`yt-thumbnail-overlay-badge-view-model`) and chip labels need keyword filtering or DOM suppression (now that chip JSON is parsed, only DOM-only variants remain).
4. Collect additional DOM/JSON samples for Watch right rail and Shorts once main surfaces are finalized.
5. Evaluate whether to expose the newly parsed playlist overlays (`WATCHED`, `Resume watching`, `Now playing`) as user-facing toggles.
6. Add renderer coverage for `channelSubMenuRenderer` / `sortFilterSubMenuRenderer` if playlist menu text needs filtering.
7. Monitor backstage header/menu strings for future filtering requirements and confirm metadata-row helper coverage across other `contentMetadataViewModel` instances.

## Sidebar & Navigation (2025-11-24 sample, NEW)

| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<ytd-guide-entry-renderer>` | `guideEntryRenderer` | ✅ Covered | Sidebar navigation items (e.g., "Shorts"). Now targeted for hiding when "Hide All Shorts" is active. |

## AI & Experimental Features (2025-11-24 sample, NEW)

| DOM tag / component | Underlying renderer / data source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<yt-button-view-model>` | `buttonViewModel` | ℹ️ **NEW** | "Ask" button (AI feature). Potential future target for category filtering. |

## 3-Dot Menu Blocking Targets (v3.0.9)

FilterTube now injects a "Block Channel" option into the 3-dot menu for the following content types. This allows users to block channels directly from the UI without visiting the channel page.

| Content Type | Targeted DOM Elements | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard Videos** | `ytd-rich-item-renderer`, `ytd-video-renderer`, `ytd-grid-video-renderer`, `ytd-compact-video-renderer` | Covers Home, Search, Channel Videos, and Sidebar suggestions. |
| **Shorts** | `ytd-reel-item-renderer`, `ytd-reel-video-renderer`, `reel-item-endpoint`, `ytm-shorts-lockup-view-model`, `ytm-shorts-lockup-view-model-v2` | Covers Shorts Shelf, Shorts Player, and Mobile/Search Shorts. Uses async fetch for channel info. |
| **Posts** | `ytd-post-renderer` | Community posts on Home and Channel pages. |
| **Playlists** | `ytd-playlist-panel-video-renderer`, `ytd-playlist-video-renderer` | Videos within a playlist view. |
| **Mobile/Compact** | `ytd-compact-promoted-video-renderer`, `ytm-compact-video-renderer`, `ytm-video-with-context-renderer` | Mobile web and specific compact layouts. |
| **Containers** | `ytm-item-section-renderer`, `ytd-rich-shelf-renderer` | Shelves and sections containing shorts/videos. |

### Menu DOM Variants (New + Legacy)

| Layer | Targeted DOM Elements | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dropdown Container** | `tp-yt-iron-dropdown`, `ytd-menu-popup-renderer` | Observer watches dropdown insertion + visibility changes. |
| **Menu List (New)** | `yt-list-view-model` | Newer YouTube menu structure; FilterTube injects a `yt-list-item-view-model`. |
| **Menu List (Legacy)** | `tp-yt-paper-listbox` | Older menu structure inside `ytd-menu-popup-renderer`. |
| **Injected Menu Item** | `yt-list-item-view-model`, `ytd-menu-service-item-renderer` | FilterTube inserts whichever matches the detected menu structure. |

**Technical Note:**
The dropdown observer lives in `js/content/block_channel.js` and uses a `MutationObserver` to detect when a dropdown container (typically `tp-yt-iron-dropdown`) is added or becomes visible. It traces back to the `lastClickedMenuButton` to identify the parent video card from the list above, then calls `content_bridge.js:injectFilterTubeMenuItem(dropdown, card)`.

Inside `injectFilterTubeMenuItem`, FilterTube waits for YouTube to populate either the **new menu list** (`yt-list-view-model`) or the **legacy menu list** (`tp-yt-paper-listbox` / `ytd-menu-popup-renderer`) before inserting the menu entry. For Shorts, an asynchronous background fetch is often required to resolve the channel handle/ID from the video URL.

### Search Artist Top Card (2026 update)

| Renderer / Host | Surface | FilterTube Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yt-official-card-view-model` | YouTube search artist/music top card | Included in DOM fallback card selectors and channel extraction paths (handle + nested channel ID fallback). |

Notes:
- This renderer can expose the handle in header metadata (`@handle`) while nested lockups carry UC IDs.
- FilterTube now treats this card as a first-class block target for handle, channel ID, and keyword matching.
