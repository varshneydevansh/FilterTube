### Why this extension?

YouTube's recommendation algorithms often push content that's designed to maximize engagement rather than provide value. FilterTube gives you back control over your viewing experience by allowing you to:

- **Filter out clickbait and low-quality content** that wastes your time
- **Block channels** that don't align with your interests or values
- **Reduce distractions** and focus on content that matters to you
- **Create a more intentional viewing experience** by curating what appears
- **Protect your privacy** with a solution that works 100% locally

Unlike YouTube's built-in features, FilterTube works across your entire YouTube experience - from home feed to search results, recommendations, and even Mix playlists.

### Privacy First Approach

FilterTube is built with privacy at its core:

- **No data collection** - We don't track your browsing, searches, or filtering preferences
- **No cloud processing** - All filtering happens locally in your browser
- **No external servers** - Your data never leaves your device
- **Open source** - Our code is transparent and auditable

### How it Works

FilterTube uses a sophisticated but efficient approach to filtering:

1. **CSS-based initial hiding** - Potential content is hidden by default using CSS
2. **Targeted unhiding** - Only content passing your filters is revealed
3. **MutationObserver technology** - Constantly monitors for new content as you scroll
4. **Smart layout preservation** - Maintains YouTube's design while removing unwanted content
5. **Minimal performance impact** - Designed to run efficiently without slowing down your browsing

### Use Cases

- **Parents** can filter out inappropriate content for their children
- **Students** can remove distracting content while doing research
- **Professionals** can maintain focus by filtering out entertainment content during work hours
- **Everyone** can escape algorithm-driven content bubbles by curating their own experience

### Technical Highlights

- **Manifest V3 compatible** for long-term browser support
- **Efficient DOM processing** with optimized selectors
- **Strategic throttling** to balance responsiveness and performance
- **Adaptable filtering** that works across YouTube's various page layouts
- **Robust channel identification** using names, handles, and channel IDs
